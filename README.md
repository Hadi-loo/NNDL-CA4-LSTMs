# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course - LSTM

## Project Description
This project is a part of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course. The project is about the implementation of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and its variants. The project is divided into two parts.  
### **Forecasting Time Series**  
The first part is about the implementation of the LSTM and its variants. this part includes the implementation of the LSTM, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the Bidirectional LSTM to forecast the time series. The implementation is done using Python and PyTorch.

### **Suicidal Tweets Classification**  
The second part is about the application of the LSTM and its variants in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This part includes the implementation of the LSTM, 2-Layer LSTM, and the CNN + 2-Layer LSTM to classify the suicidal and non-suicidal tweets. The implementation is done using Python and PyTorch.
